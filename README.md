# WEB103 Project 3 - _Virtual Community Space_

Submitted by: **Christopher Mendez**

About this web app: **A virtual community space with an interactive interface that allows users to explore events by location.**

Time spent: **5** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x] **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT \* FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [x] **The web app displays a title.**
- [x] **Website includes a visual interface that allows users to select a location they would like to view.**
  - [x] _Note: A non-visual list of links to different locations is insufficient._
- [x] **Each location has a detail page with its own unique URL.**
- [x] **Clicking on a location navigates to its corresponding detail page and displays list of all events from the `events` table associated with that location.**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] An additional page shows all possible events
  - [ ] Users can sort _or_ filter events by location.
- [ ] Events display a countdown showing the time remaining before that event
  - [ ] Events appear with different formatting when the event has passed (ex. negative time, indication the event has passed, crossed out, etc.).
